'''
Write the necessary code to print the result of the following formula:

	(15.7 * 3.6 - 34.9 * 0.9) / (68.9 - 2.1)

'''

result1 = (15.7 * 3.6 - 34.9 * 0.9)
result2 = (68.9 - 2.1)

result = result1 / result2

print(result)

# or just: print((15.7 * 3.6 - 34.9 * 0.9) / (68.9 - 2.1))
# I'm sure you didn't mean just that :)
